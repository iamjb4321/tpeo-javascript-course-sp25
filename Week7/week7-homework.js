/*
Question 1: Use a for-loop to make a 2D array of Car objects that is 10 rows by 10 columns. 
Each Car object should have the following properties: model, color, year, mpg, and id. 
Each Car object should have the same values for model, color, year, and mpg but different values 
for id that increment with each Car object made. For example, the first car made should have id = 1, 
the second car made should have id = 2, etc.
*/


/*
Question 2: Write a function getCarsBetweenIds that takes two parameters: idMin and idMax. 
Return a new array of the Car objects that have an id between idMin and idMax (idMin <= id <= idMax). 
Before returning the array, change all the Car objects’ color property to “blue”. Test your function 
by calling it 3 times and printing the results to the terminal.
